Knowledge and Data Engineering Meets Large Language Models: Challenges and Opportunities Workshop @ICDE'26

## Workshop Objectives
This workshop on the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge and Data Engineering is a pioneering event at top-tier conferences. It brings together experts to share recent challenges and opportunities, aiming to inspire future research. With oral presentations and poster sessions, the workshop will provide a platform for researchers from natural language processing (NLP), knowledge engineering, and database management to discuss ideas, review past work, and explore new directions. The focus is on the synergy between LLMs and knowledge and data engineering from two aspects. The first explores how LLMs empower Knowledge Base (KB) and Database (DB) management tasks, such as data cleansing, relation inference, and query processing. The second examines how KBs and DBs enhance LLMs, e.g., through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-modal data management, and more. By including participants from academia and industry, the workshop aims to connect practical applications with research, encouraging collaboration that will shape the future of intelligent KB and DB systems.

## Workshop Topics and Themes
To encourage researchers with relevant backgrounds to engage and contribute, we propose to organize the workshop to explore the interplay between KBs, DBs, and LLMs, to gain insights from both academia and industry. We will welcome theory and methodology papers falling into the scope of the following themes, including but not limited to:
### LLM-empowered knowledge and data engineering
- LLM-enabled Improvements to Foundational KB and DB Algorithms
- Database Design, Configuration, and Tuning with LLMs
- Data Cleansing and Augmentation with LLMs
- Data Indexing and Query Optimization with LLMs
- Reasoning Over Knowledge Bases with LLMs
- Automated Data Understanding and Visualization with LLMs
- Novel Query Interfaces and Interactive Query Refinement with LLMs
- Context-aware Data Retrieval with LLMs
- Personalized Query Optimization with LLMs 

### Knowledge base and database-enhanced LLMs
- Data Collection and Preparation for LLMs
- DB-inspired Techniques for Modeling, Storage, and Provenance of LLMs
- Vector Data Management for LLMs
- Data and Metadata Management for LLM Life Cycle
